1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,799
So they've got us building a messaging app,

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,099
think iMessage, WhatsApp,

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,019
whatever one you want to think of.

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,419
You would think with so many of them

5
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,060
that this would be easy to do.

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,019
It is most definitely not easy to do.

7
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,560
Game plan, a lot of planning,

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,940
a lot of working with the, with cursor

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,879
and just trying to figure out what to do next for things.

10
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,500
It's going not great.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,859
Well, well, it's going all right.

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,719
It's just, it's really making me stressed out a little

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,479
with so many bugs and things to deal with.

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,039
When testing with the Android emulators,

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,759
since I don't have an Android physical device,

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,719
so that's most of the challenge I feel like.

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,439
What have I learned?

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,520
I've learned once again, why I don't want to do mobile dev,

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,639
why I never wanted to get into this.

20
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,598
I don't even really want to touch my own phone anymore.

21
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:53,520
This is hurting me.
